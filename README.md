# The Movie Database API Project

This is a collaborative project with [Libby Henry](https://github.com/LibbyH52) that uses the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Under the repository name, click **"Code"** and copy the link to clone the repository using **"HTTPS"**
- After copying the link, open a terminal on your computer - this step can also be done in the terminal in your preferred IDE or Code Editor
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be saved
- Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL: [https://github.com/KirstChat/movie-db-api-project.git](https://github.com/KirstChat/movie-db-api-project.git)
- Press Enter to create a local clone
- Open the terminal and run `npm install` to install required packages
- If you are unable to install packages, download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- To run the app in development mode, run the `npm start` command in the terminal

To add your own TMDB API Key, follow these steps:
